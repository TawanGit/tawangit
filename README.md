Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>
Iâ€™m Thiago Tawan, a full stack engineer based in Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· â€” passionate about building clean, scalable, and modern applications.

Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of Java and AWS, focusing on backend architecture, cloud-native development, and distributed systems. I believe that great software is not only about code, but about solving real problems with performance and reliability.

On the frontend, I enjoy crafting pixel-perfect interfaces with smooth UX, transforming designs into fast, accessible experiences that just feel right.

Letâ€™s build something awesome together!
